# Ganpati-Bapa
While I'm enjoying the Ganesh Chaturthi and noticing ample amount of status on social media about "Ganesha", made me think to develop atleast a face using my favorite and two of the core technologies[HTML & CSS] for building Web pages.

So here, have put some efforts to develope it.

Happy coding! :)
