# Ganpati-Bapa
While I'm enjoying the Ganesh Chaturthi and noticing ample amount of status on social media about "Ganesha", it made me think to develop at least a face using my favorite and two of the core technologies[HTML & CSS] for building Web pages.

So here, I have put some effort into developing it.

Happy coding! :)
